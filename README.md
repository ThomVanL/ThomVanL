### About

I am a certified Microsoft Azure consultant from Belgium, who assists independent software vendors by leveraging Microsoft Azure and open source technologies.

Born and raised in East-Flanders, I started my journey into information technology at the age of six when my family bought a desktop computer that was powerful enough to run Windows 3.11. In the past, I have been a factory worker, a casual programmer and a Microsoft .NET consultant.

With my colleagues, I frequently produce presentations and workshops on the topic of DevSecOps. More recently I have discussed the workings of Windows Containers and how it fits into the container ecosystem. Along with Microsoft MVP [Micha Wets](https://github.com/michawets/), I was asked to talk about Kubernetes in a Microsoft world at the Microsoft Headquarters in Germany and about Azure Governance at CloudBrew in Belgium.

In May 2020, I was awarded the Azure Content Hero award by Microsoft for having created original content, sample code or learning resources and documented and shared experiences and lessons to help others to build on the Azure cloud platform. 

Two years later, in 2022, I was honoured to receive the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award in the Microsoft Azure category.
